     802.15.4 Informational Element encapsulation of ICMPv6 Router

Abstract

   In TSCH mode of 802.15.4, as described by [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal],
   opportunities for broadcasts are limited to specific times and
   specific channels.  An enhanced beacon must be broadcast periodically
   by every router to keep all nodes in sync.  This document provides a
   mechanism by which other small ICMPv6 packets, such as Router
   Advertisements may be carried within the Enhanced Beacon, providing
   standard IPv6 router/host protocol.

1.  Introduction

   Explain why broadcasts are rare, and why we need them.  What the
   Enhanced Beacon is, and what Information Elements are, and how the
   IETF has a subtype for that area.

   Explain what kind of things could be placed in Information Elements,
   how big they could be, and how they could be compressed.

1.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
   implementations.

2.  Protocol Definition

3.  Security Considerations

4.  IANA Considerations

   Allocate a new number from Registry FOO.
