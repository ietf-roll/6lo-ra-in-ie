--- abstract

In TSCH mode of IEEE STD 802.15.4, opportunities for broadcasts are limited to
specific times and specific channels.  Nodes in a TSCH network typically
frequently send Enhanced Beacon (EB) frames to announce the presence of the
network.  This document provides a mechanism by which small details critical
for new nodes (pledges) and long sleeping nodes may be carried within the Enhanced Beacon.

# Introduction        {#problems}

{{RFC7554}} describes the use of the time-slotted channel
hopping (TSCH) mode of {{ieee802154}}.  As further detailed in
{{RFC8180}}, an Enhanced Beacon (EB) is transmitted during a slot
designated a broadcast slot.

## Use of BCP 14 Terminology          {#Terminology}

{::boilerplate bcp14}

Other terminology can be found in {{I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture}} in section
2.1.

## Layer-2 Synchronization

As explained in section 6 of {{RFC8180}}, the Enhanced Beacon (EB)
has a number of purposes: synchronization of ASN and Join Metric, carrying timeslot
template identifier, carrying the channel hopping sequence identifier, and
indicating the TSCH SlotFrame.

The EB is used by nodes already part of a TSCH network to
annouce its existence.
Receiving an EB allows a Joining Node (pledge) to learn about the network and
synchronize to it.
The EB may also be used as a means for a node already part of the network to
re-synchronize {{RFC7554}}.

There is a limited number of timeslots designated as a broadcast slot by each
router in the network. Considering 10ms slots and a slot-frame length of 100,
these slots are rare and could result in only 1 slot/s for a broadcast, which
needs to be used for the beacon.  Additional broadcasts for Router
Advertisements, or Neighbor Discovery could even more scarce.

## Layer-3 synchronization: IPv6 Router Solicitations and Advertisements

At layer 3, {{RFC4861}} defines a mechanism by which nodes learn about
routers by receiving multicast Router Advertisements (RA). 
If no RA is heard within a set time, then a Router Solicitation (RS) may be
sent as multicast, to which an RA will be received, usually unicast.

Although {{RFC6775}} reduces the amount of multicast necessary to do address
resolution via Neighbor Solicitation (NS) messages, it still requires multicast
of either RAs or RS.  This is an expensive operation for two reasons: First, there
are few multicast timeslots for unsolicited RAs; and second, if a pledge node does not
hear an RA, and decides to send a RS, a broadcast aloha slot is consumed with
unencrypted traffic. In this case, a unicast RS may be sent in response.

This is a particularly acute issue for the join process for the following
reasons:

1. use of a multicast slot by even a non-malicious unauthenticated node for
   a Router Solicitation (RS) may overwhelm that time slot.

2. it may require many seconds of on-time before a new pledge hears a Router
   Advertisement (RA) that it can use.

3. a new pledge may listen to many Enhanced Beacons (EB) before it can pick an
   appropriate network and/or closest Join Assistant to attach to. If it must
   listen for a RA as well as find the Enhanced Beacon (EB), then the process may
   take a very long time.

This document defines a new IETF IE subtype to provide join and enrollment information to prospective
pledges in a more efficient way.

# Protocol Definition

{{RFC8137}} creates a registry for new IETF IE subtypes.
This document allocates a new subtype.

The new IE subtype structure is as follows.  As explained in
{{RFC8137}} the length of the Sub-Type Content can be calculated from the
container, so no length information is necessary.

{: #iesubtype title="IE subtype structure"}


R
: the Router Advertisement R-flag is set if the sending node will act as a
Router for host-only nodes that need addressing via unicast Router
Solicitation messages.

: in most cases, every node sending a beacon will set this flag, and in a
typical mesh, this will be every single node.  When this bit is not set, it
indicates that this node may be under provisioned, or may have no additional
slots for additional nodes.  This could make this node more interesting to an
attacker. 

P
: if the Proxy Address P-flag is set, then the lower 64-bits of the Join Proxy's
link-local address follows the network ID.  If the Proxy Address bit is not set,
then the Link Layer address of the Join Proxy is identical to the Layer-2 8-byte
address used to originate this enhanced beacon.
In either case, the destination layer-2 address of
this beacon may use the layer-2 address which was used to originate the beacon.

: this bit only indicates if another part of the structure is present.

proxy priority (proxy prio)
: this field indicates the willingness of the sender to act as join proxy.
Lower value indicates greater willingness to act as a Join Proxy as described in
{{I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security}}. Values range 0x00 (most willing)
to 0x7e (least willing).  A priority of 0x7f indicates that
the announcer should never be considered as a viable enrollment proxy.   Only
unenrolled pledges look at this value.

: lower values in this field indicate that the transmitter may have more
capacity to handle unencrypted traffic.  A higher value may indicate that the
transmitter is low on neighbor cache entries, or other resources.

rank priority
: the rank "priority" is set by the 6LR which sent the beacon and is an
indication of how willing this 6LR is to serve as an RPL parent within a
particular network ID.  This is a local value to be determined in other
work.  It might be calculated from RPL rank, and it may include some
modifications based upon current number of children, or number of neighbor
cache entries available.  This value MUST be ignored by pledges, it is for
enrolled devices only.  Lower values are better.

: an attacker can use this value to determine which nodes are potentially
more interesting.  
Nodes which are less willing to be parents likely have more traffic, and an
attacker could use this information to determine which nodes would be more
interesting to attack or disrupt.

pan priority
: the pan priority is a value set by the DODAG root to indicate the relative
priority of this LLN compared to those with different PANIDs.  This value may
be used as part of the enrollment priority, but typically is used by devices
which have already enrolled, and need to determine which PAN to pick.
Unenrolled pledges MAY consider this value when selecting a PAN to join.
Enrolled devices MAY consider this value when looking for an eligible parent device.

: an attacker can use this value, along with the observed PANID in the Beacon
to determine which PANIDs have more network resources, and may have more
interesting traffic.

Join Proxy lower-64
:  if the P bit is set, then 64 bits (8 bytes) of
address are present. This field provides the suffix of the Link-Local
address of the Join Proxy. The associated prefix is well-known as
fe80::/64.

: this field communicates a lower-64 bits that should be used for this nodes'
layer-3 address, if it should not be derived from the layer-2 address. 


network ID
: this is a variable length field, up to 16-bytes in size that uniquely identifies
this network, potentially among many networks that are operating in the same
frequencies in overlapping physical space.  The length of this field can be
calculated as being whatever is left in the Information Element.

In a 6tisch network, where RPL {{RFC6550}} is used as the mesh routing protocol, the
network ID can be constructed from a SHA256 hash of the prefix (/64) of the
network.  That is just a suggestion for a default value.
In some LLNs where multiple PANIDs may lead to the same management device
(the JRC), then a common value that is the same across all PANs MUST be configured.

# Security Considerations

All of the contents of this Information Element are sent in the clear.  
The containing Enhanced Beacon is not encrypted.
This is a restriction in the cryptographic architecture of the TSCH
mechanism.
In order to decrypt or do integrity checking of layer-2 frames in TSCH, the
TSCH Absolute Slot Number (ASN) is needed.  
The Enhanced Beacon provides the ASN to new (and long-sleeping) nodes.

The Enhanced Beagon is authenticated at the layer-2 level using 802.15.4
mechanisms using the network-wide keying material.  Nodes which are enrolled
will have the network-wide keying material and can validate the beacon,
providing them with a trusted

Pledges which have not yet enrolled are unable to authenticate the beacons,
and will be forced to temporarily take the contents on faith.
After enrollment, a newly enrolled node will be able to return to the beacon and
validate it.

In addition to the enrollment and join information described in this
document, the Enhanced Beacon contains a description of the TSCH schedule to
be used by the transmitter of this packet.
The schedule can provide an attacker with a list of channels and frequencies
on which communication will occur. 
Knowledge of this can help an attacker to more efficiently jam
communications, although there is future work being considered to make some
of the schedule less visible.  
Encrypting the schedule does not prevent an attacker from jamming, but rather
increases the energy cost of doing that jamming.






# Privacy Considerations

The use of a network ID may reveal information about the network.  The use of
a SHA256 hash of the DODAGID, rather than using the DODAGID directly provides
some cover the addresses used within the network.  The DODAGID is usually the
IPv6 address of the root of the RPL mesh.

An interloper with a radio sniffer would be able to use the network ID to map
out the extent of the mesh network.

# IANA Considerations

Allocate a new number TBD-XXX from Registry IETF IE Sub-type ID, as defined by {{RFC8137}}.
This entry should be called 6tisch-Join-Info, and should refer to this document.
