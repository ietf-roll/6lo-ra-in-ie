--- abstract

In TSCH mode of 802.15.4, as described by {{I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal}},
opportunities for broadcasts are limited to specific times and specific
channels.  An enhanced beacon must be broadcast periodically by every router
to keep all nodes in sync.  This document provides a mechanism by which other
small ICMPv6 packets, such as Router Advertisements may be carried within the
Enhanced Beacon, providing standard IPv6 router/host protocol.

# Introduction        {#problems}

Explain why broadcasts are rare, and why we need them.
What the Enhanced Beacon is, and what Information Elements are, and how the IETF has a subtype for that area.

Explain what kind of things could be placed in Information Elements, how big they could be, and how they could be compressed.

## Terminology          {#Terminology}

In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
{{!RFC2119}} and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
implementations.
